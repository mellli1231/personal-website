        <h1>Who am I</h1>
        <p>My name is Melody, and I am a 3rd year CS student at Simon Fraser University!
            At the start of university, I had trouble deciding what I wanted to do in the future, but fortunately one coding class
            led me to go into Computer Science. 
        </p>
        <p>The more I learn about computing, the more passionate I become to learn as much as I can 
            about all the different fields of study there is to offer.
        </p>
        <p>Although I invest a large amount of time into my academics and personal projects, I also like to enjoy my free time in various ways!
            I love to explore local restaraunts and businesses to see what fun things are near me. Whenever I find a business that I come to love, 
            it is very fulfilling to know that I could have never known about this place before.
        </p>
        <p>I also love to just stay at home &#40; especially on cold and rainy days&#41; and relax. I would sometimes bake for my family
            and the people I love to improve on my kitchen skills, although I am not very good at cooking &#128517; Occasionally I would explore 
            some new hobbies such as crocheting, piano, drawing, and guitar.
        </p>
        <p>Feel free to reach out to me, I am always open to making new connections! &#128513; </p>
