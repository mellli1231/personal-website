<h1>My Personal Website</h1>
<div class = "introduction">
  <p>I have developed my own website using HTML and CSS as an introduction to everyone! This website consists of a main page, a home page, and subpages containing my personal projects, my timeline in since being introduced to computer science, and more personal information about myself.</p>
  <p>One consistent feature of all these sites is the background, which I have made in Blender as my first project. </p>

  <h2>Main Page</h2>
  <p>This page contains a general introduction, and links to my socials. The social links have been styled so that the platforms icon has been included, for both visual aesthetic, but also easier recognition for those unfamiliar with the platform. At the bottom, the 'About Me' link will then open a new tab for the home page to go into more detail about myself.</p>

  <h2>About Me Page</h2>
  <p>This page contains the subpages to know me more in detail. The reason to separate this information from the main page is to not overload the reader with information and provides a choice to get a more general, or more detailed idea about myself.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In <b>'My Projects'</b>, it contains all projects I have worked on, personal or academic. These have been separated with current projects I am working on, or completed projects. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In <b>'My Timeline'</b>, this gives provides a timeline of what I have been learning the past few years. Along with the dates, there is a short summary of what has happened in each time period.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In <b>'Get to Know Me'</b>, I am able to share about my personal life. In addition to just words, I have added pictures to add some style variation and give more visuals to highlight my personality. The addition of pictures has been my favourite feature of this website not just because of how well it looks, but also how much more easy it is for a reader to look at a picture and already have an idea of how your life looks like.</p>
